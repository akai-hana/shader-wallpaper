# shader-wallpaper
A repo where I store my shader wallpaper setup: programs, configs, scripts and shaders.

NOTE: precision in some /shadow/ shaders has been lowered from mediump to lowp for performance's sake. i haven't observed any changes, but feel free to revert if needed

to-do: move scripts from dotfiles to here
